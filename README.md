https://www.maketecheasier.com/Whatsapp-security-exploit-missed-call-hack

We’ve witnessed HACKERS attack on Whatsapp, where all the HACKERS had to do was telephone call Whatsapp victims❗️There are no links to click or websites to visit; the HACKERS SIMPLY MISSCALLS numbers of Whatsapp victims and HACKERS INJECTS SPYWARE MALWARE HACKERS SOFTWARE into WHATSAPP APP in PHONES of VICTIMS❗️

This is a scary attack, as there’s not much the user can do to combat this is just UNINSTALL Whatsapp App and REINSTALL Whatsapp App❗️

This attack used what’s called a “buffer overflow” to get into people’s apps. Buffer overflow attacks are when HACKERS cause malicious code to “ inject insert ” into the source code of the software they want to attack. Software apps have a buffer within that can be used to input things❗️

If software apps not secure the buffer, then HACKERS can cause software apps to write data to add data into buffer software apps. HACKERS ADD MALICIOUS CODE “ INJECT INSERT “ INTO THE SOURCE CODE of software apps , at which point the HACKERS CAN MODIFY SOFTWARE APPS and then HACKERS CAN TAKE CONTROL APPS TO DO WHAT HACKERS WANT❗️= HACKERS HIJACKED APPS = HACKERS HACKED APPS❗️

When a Whatsapp user receives a call, the app needs to know what the user wants to do with it. Therefore, it uses the buffer to store the action the user wants to take, such as answering the call or hanging up. In this window, the HACKERS COULD INJECT INSERT STUFF CODE INTO Whatsapp SOFTWARE BUFFER and cause it to overflow into the app’s code, then HACKERS USE THIS Whatsapp HIJACKED purposes : TO SPY and TO STEAL DATA and TO HACK Whatsapp❗️
